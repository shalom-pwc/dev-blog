# SELAM'S DEV-BLOG
Dev-blog is my first project to show what i have learned in class. Its simple and made from scratch.

## My Blog Structure

It contains three pages with the same header and footer.The header is fixed and it has the logo of my blog and a navigation bar.

### The three pages are:
1. **Home page**/*index.html*
    - This page is the Frist main page. It contains navigation bar,feautuers, sections and footer.
2. **Post page**/*_post-template.html*
    - This page contains navigation bar,title,short describtion,a step by step process with code examples and footer.
3. **About page**/*about.html*
    - The About page contains navigation bar with my CV,title,my profile,short describtion and footer.
